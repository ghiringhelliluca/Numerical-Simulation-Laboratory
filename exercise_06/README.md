# Ising Model Monte Carlo Simulations

This project contains two separate implementations of Monte Carlo simulations for the Ising model using two different update techniques: Metropolis and Gibbs sampling.

## Project Structure

The code is organized into two main directories:

- `M(RT)^2/` contains the simulation using the Metropolis algorithm  
- `GIBBS/` contains the simulation using the Gibbs sampling algorithm

Each of these folders contains the following structure:

```
.
├── SOURCE/          # Source files (NSL_EQUILIBRATOR.cpp, NSL_SIMULATOR.cpp, libraries, functions)
├── INPUT/           # Input files (e.g., input.dat)
├── OUTPUT/          # Output results (simulation data, analysis results)
```

The only difference between the two is the value set in the `SIMULATION_TYPE` field inside `input.dat`, which selects the update method to be used.


## Purpose of Each Main File

Each directory contains two main programs:

- `NSL_EQUILIBRATOR.cpp`  
  Used to perform simulations at a single temperature (T = 2) to monitor the evolution of individual thermodynamic variables (e.g., energy or magnetization) and study equilibration.

- `NSL_SIMULATOR.cpp`  
  Used to perform full simulations across a range of temperatures using the blocking method for statistical analysis.

## Usage

### To compile


To build the desired executable, navigate to either the `M(RT)^2/` or `GIBBS/` folder. Open the `Makefile` and set the target program:


```makefile
FILENAME = NSL_EQUILIBRATOR  # or NSL_SIMULATOR
EXE = equilibrator           # or simulator
```

Then compile in the `SOURCE/` folder with:

```bash
make
```

### To run

Run the compiled executable as follows:

```bash
./equilibrator.exe
# or
./simulator.exe
```

Choose the appropriate executable depending on whether you're studying equilibration or running the full simulation.


### Configuration via `input.dat`

Simulation parameters are defined in the `input.dat` file.

To measure the magnetization, modify the third number in the line that starts with:

```
SIMULATION_TYPE
```

Set this value to the desired external magnetic field H. The default is `0`, no external field.

### Output 

The `OUTPUT/` directory is structured to separate the results of equilibration from those of the full simulations:

- Main output files:
Contain the results of full simulations across the temperature range, including averages and statistical uncertainties of thermodynamic quantities such as energy, heat capacity, magnetization, and magnetic susceptibility. These are generated by `NSL_SIMULATOR.cpp` using the blocking method.

- `EQUILIBRATION/` subdirectory:
Contains the raw time series of observables (e.g., energy or magnetization) at a fixed temperature (usually T = 2). These are produced by `NSL_EQUILIBRATOR.cpp` and are used to assess when the system reaches thermal equilibrium. This helps identify a suitable number of steps to discard as thermalization before starting the production phase.
