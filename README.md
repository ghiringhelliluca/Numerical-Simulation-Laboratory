# Numerical Simulation Laboratory - Course Repository

This repository contains the complete set of exercises for the **Numerical Simulation Laboratory** course, completed by **Luca Ghiringhelli**.

The repository is organized by exercise folders, each dedicated to a different numerical problem or computational technique in physics and applied mathematics. The main goals are to develop simulation tools using C++ and to perform data analysis and visualization using Python.


## Repository Structure

### Exercises 1 to 10

Each of the first 10 exercises is organized as follows:

- A Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) which contains:
  - The text of the exercise,
  - Explanations and plots,
  - The solution or discussion of results.

- Corresponding subdirectories that contain:
  - `C++ source code` implementing the simulation logic,
  - Input parameter files,
  - Output data used for post-processing and plotting.

Each folder also includes a `README.md` file explaining:
- The contents of the folder,
- How to compile and execute the code,
- Any specific configuration or data handling details.

These exercises cover topics such as:
- Random number generation,
- Monte Carlo methods,
- Simulated Annealing,
- Equilibrium statistical mechanics,
- Genetic Algorithms.

### Exercises 11 & 12

- These two exercises are located in the same folder and were developed entirely within a Jupyter Notebook.
