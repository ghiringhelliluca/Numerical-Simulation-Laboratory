# Structure

- Each folder corresponds to a specific exercise.
- Inside each folder, you will find source files (`main.cpp`, etc..) and a `Makefile`.

## How to Compile

To compile the code in any exercise folder, simply open a terminal, navigate to the desired directory, and run:

```bash
make
```

This will generate an executable named:

```bash
main.exe
```

## How to Run

After compilation, execute the program by running:

```bash
./main.exe
```

The code will automatically generate the necessary output `.dat` files in the same folder.
