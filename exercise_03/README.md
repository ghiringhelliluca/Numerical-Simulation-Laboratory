# Structure

- One folder corresponds to the single exercise.
- Inside you will find source files (`main.cpp`, etc..) and a `Makefile`.

## How to Compile

To compile the code simply open a terminal and run:

```bash
make
```

This will generate an executable named:

```bash
main.exe
```

## How to Run

After compilation, execute the program by running:

```bash
./main.exe
```

The code will automatically generate the necessary output `.dat` files.
